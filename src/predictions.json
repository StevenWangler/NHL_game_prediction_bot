        "explanation": "COL has better form going into the match with a 7-3 record in their last 10 games compared to NYR's 4-5. COL also has a better goal differential and has been scoring more goals recently. However NYR is playing at home where they have a strong record of 15 wins and 7 losses, giving them an advantage. Thus, while COL has a higher chance of winning, it is not a high confidence prediction."

TOR has a positive season goal differential, as opposed to NYI's negative one. Thus, TOR being the home team, coupled with their better form, leads to a high confidence prediction of TOR winning this game."
