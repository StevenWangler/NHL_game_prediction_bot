        "confidence rating": "medium",
        "simulation results": "4-2-4, DAL",
        "explanation": "Given the available statistics, DAL seems to have a higher chance of winning. They have a better season goal differential, better goal differential percentage, fewer goals against and more goals for. Moreover, their record on the road is quite impressive, having won more than twice the games they have lost. In their recent 10 games, DAL also managed to net more goals than DET while conceding only slightly more. Despite the home team advantage for DET, our simulations predict a win for DAL in this matchup."

        "confidence rating": "medium",
        "simulation results": "6-4-0, MTL",
        "explanation": "The match seems to be quite competitive, especially considering the home advantage factor. MTL has a better record in the last 10 games, with just as many wins as losses, as opposed to OTT's 6 losses and 3 wins. On the other hand, the away team has been scoring more goals in recent games, although they also conceded more. OTT's poor road record also works in the favor of MTL. Despite these, the overall win-loss records on the season and current form indicate a slightly better chance for MTL. Simulations also favor MTL win in this match."

        "confidence rating": "low",
        "simulation results": "5-5-0, draw",
        "explanation": "This matchup is rather balanced. Despite TBL having slightly stronger performance in their last 10 games, both sides have an equal loss record of 3 losses. Their goals for and against in the last 10 games are also comparable. It is the same for the win and loss record for the season. Plus, both teams are on a losing streak. The game being at PHI's home gives them a slight home advantage, but their home record isn't particularly superior to TBL's road record. Taking everything into account, this match might end up in a draw."

        "confidence rating": "medium",
        "simulation results": "3-7-0, VGK",
        "explanation": "VGK has a better recent record, with more wins in their last 10 games predominantly. Their stronger season goal differential and goal differential percentage further indicate that VGK has a highly efficient attack. While NYI played less games but lost more, VGK is performing well this season overall despite equal wins and losses on the road. Considering the current form as well, VGK seems to have a better chance in this matchup, as indicated by the simulation results."

        "confidence rating": "low",
        "simulation results": "5-4-1, MIN",
        "explanation": "This game appears to be quite balanced, with both teams showing similar forms. WSH has a slightly better win-loss record both overall as well as in their last 10 games, but the recent form of both teams is very similar. Both teams have the same win-loss record away and at home respectively, and they have very similar streak momentum, with MIN on a winning streak and WSH on a losing streak. The probabilities lean more towards MIN winning because of home advantage and their better scoring form in the last ten games, although the difference is not significant hence the confidence rating is low."

        "confidence rating": "medium",
        "simulation results": "5-3-2, CGY",
        "explanation": "Although both teams have almost the same win-loss record over the season, CGY seems to be in slightly better form. They have won more games in their last 10 matchups (6) than STL (4) and have also scored more goals in the process. Their goal differential is also lesser than STL and hence they emerge as slight favorites especially considering the home advantage. However, the confidence level for this prediction is medium considering the close nature of the matchup."

        "simulation results": "8-2-0, EDM",
        "explanation": "EDM is in an extraordinary form right now with a continuous winning streak of 13 games. In their last 10 games, moreover, they haven't lost a single match and have scored significantly more goals than they've conceded. Their overall form this season is also better than CBJ. CBJ, on the other hand, is on a losing streak and has a poor performance both in their recent games and over the season. Given these data, it's highly likely that EDM will maintain their winning streak."

        "simulation results": "2-8-0, BUF",
        "explanation": "ANA is currently struggling in form with more losses in their current 10 game bracket, while BUF has more wins. ANA's overall performance this season has also been worse than BUF's with more losses and fewer wins. Additionally, ANA's goal differential over the season is much lower compared to BUF's. This, combined with ANA's rather significant home losses, makes BUF a favorite despite being the away team. Simulation results significantly favor BUF in this game."

        "simulation results": "3-7-0, NYR",
        "explanation": "SJS has been performing poorly this season with a significantly worse record compared to NYR. Their recent form is equally concerning. SJS has also conceded more and scored fewer goals in their last 10 games compared to NYR. Furthermore, SJS has a notably low goal differential over the season whereas NYR's is positive. These statistics overwhelmingly favor NYR to win the matchup."
