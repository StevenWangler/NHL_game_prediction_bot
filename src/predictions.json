        "explanation": "Using a combination of season statistics, recent performance, and home advantage, the model calculated the probabilities of each team winning. Simulations were run using Poisson distributions to estimate the number of goals, leading to a predicated number of wins for each team over a large number of simulated matches."

Using Poisson distributions for simulations, the likelihood of victories and expected goals were calculated, taking into account the teams' offensive and defensive records, particularly in the stated timeframe."

        "explanation": "Given the superior season record, home advantage, and recent form of the home team compared to the away team, the model favors them. Despite the home team's greater number of overtime losses, they have a reasonable amount of home wins and a better goal differential. This influenced the prediction alongside simulated matches which rely on statistical data and recent performances."

Despite the home advantage, the away team has a better season record. The model's simulations suggest a higher chance of an away victory but acknowledge the variability inherent in hockey games."
