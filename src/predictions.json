        "simulation results": "DET: 6 Wins, PHI: 4 Wins",
        "explanation": "Based on recent form, home advantage, streaks, and goal differentials, I have nominated DET as the more likely winner with 57% chance. However, this is a relatively close game which is reflected in my medium confidence rating. DET has shown slightly better recent performance, has a positive goal difference, and the game takes place at their home venue. However, PHI has a stronger performance margin on the away games compared to DET's at home which means they have a decent shot at an upset."

        "explanation": "Both teams have not been performing well lately, with MTL on a 3 game losing streak and NYI on a single loss. But NYI edges out MTL in terms of season record, goals for and against, and goal differential, which leads to my prediction of NYI winning. However, given the close percentages and recent forms, my confidence rating is medium."

        "simulation results": "OTT: 3 Wins, BOS: 7 Wins",
        "explanation": "The Boston Bruins (BOS) are in top form, having won 6 out of their last ten games, with a 5 game winning streak ongoing. This is in contrast to Ottawa Senators' (OTT) middling form winning 4 out of the last 10 games. Additionally, BOS has a superior season record, goal differential, and stats for goals for and against. Given their impressive performance on the road, and high number of goals scored recently, my prediction leans towards a BOS win with high confidence."

        "simulation results": "TBL: 6 Wins, ARI: 4 Wins",
        "explanation": "The Tampa Bay Lightning (TBL) has a stronger recent performance record, with seven wins in their last ten games. The home ground advantage at Amalie Arena, where TBL has a solid record of 15 wins to 5 losses also tips the scales in their favor. However, the Arizona Coyotes (ARI) have a similar season goal differential and have managed a decent number of wins on the road. This leads to my medium confidence rating."

        "explanation": "Carolina Hurricanes (CAR) have a stronger recent performance, with seven wins out of their last ten games, compared to New Jersey Devils' (NJD) five out of ten. CAR also has a higher season goal differential and fewer total goals against this season. However, NJD has shown strong performance on the road, and both teams have opposing streaks, with CAR coming off a loss and NJD off a win. Thus, I rate my confidence in this prediction as medium."

        "explanation": "Dallas Stars (DAL) have superior form in comparison to Anaheim Ducks (ANA) with 6 wins out of their past 10 games. DAL also boasts a substantial season goal differential, translating to more goals scored and less conceded. Further, DAL's home record is far more impressive against ANA's away performances. Despite both teams last riding on a win, the overall stats heavily favor DAL, hence a high confidence rating."

        "explanation": "Minnesota Wild (MIN) and Nashville Predators (NSH) are both on similar form, with each team winning half of their last ten games. Overall, their standings for the season are quite close. However, MIN are on a current winning streak of 3 games, which may boost their confidence. They also have a home advantage, as the game is at Xcel Energy Center. Despite this, NSH's overall stats slightly edge out those of MIN, making it a very close match hence my prediction confidence of medium."

        "explanation": "Calgary Flames (CGY) are the favorites in this matchup against the Columbus Blue Jackets (CBJ). Despite a current losing streak, CGY's overall record for the season is better than CBJ's, and they also have a superior goal differential. Furthermore, CGY has the home advantage. However, given the somewhat volatile recent forms of both teams the confidence rating remains medium."

        "explanation": "Edmonton Oilers (EDM) are in top form, achieving a perfect record in their last 10 games, and are currently on a 14 game winning streak. In contrast, Chicago Blackhawks (CHI) are struggling, with 7 losses in their last ten games. EDM's superior season goal differential, lower totals goals against, and a formidable home record mean they are substantial favourites. My confidence in this prediction is high."
