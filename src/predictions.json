        "explanation": "Based on the provided data, NYR seems to be in a more favourable position to win the game. They have demonstrated strong performance in their recent games with a winning streak of 6 and 7 wins in their last 10 games compared to NYI's 3. Furthermore, NYR has a positive season goal differential and a higher goal differential percentage indicating they score more than they concede on average, compared to NYIâ€™s negative stats in these categories. In addition, NYR has a strong record on the road with 16 wins out of 25 games, suggesting they perform well even when they're not playing at home. Therefore, my prediction favours NYR with a high level of confidence."

        "simulation results": "COL 7 Wins, ARI 3 Wins",
        "explanation": "Given the data provided, COL seems to be at a distinct advantage. COL has a reasonable win rate in recent games, even though they lost the most recent game, and they have a strong home record with 20 wins and 5 losses. Overall, their season has been more successful than ARI's, as indicated by their goal differential of 27 compared to ARI's -14. Consequently, even though hockey games can be unpredictable and ARI could surprise with a win, the probabilities appear to support a COL victory with a high confidence rating."

        "simulation results": "PIT 4 Wins, LAK 6 Wins",
        "explanation": "While the home team PIT has a decent performance on home ice (13 wins vs. 9 losses), the away team LAK has shown impressive resilience on the road with 17 wins and just 7 losses, suggesting a better form when playing away. The recent match performances show LAK with a slight edge, winning more games in their last 10 compared to PIT. However, games between these teams could go either way, therefore the confidence rating is set to medium, leaning more towards LAK due to their recent form and away record."
