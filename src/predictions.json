The outcome is determined by comparing the total number of wins generated for the home and away teams over 10,000 simulations. The average goals predicted for each team are also calculated from the simulated data. The confidence rating is based on the difference between the teams' winning percentages from the simulations."

        "explanation": "The prediction uses a Poisson distribution to simulate possible scorelines based on the average goals scored by each team in their last 10 games. The outcome is predicted after performing 10,000 simulations. The home team, given their previous performance and current streak, is less likely to win than the away team, despite being on a winning streak. The away team, though currently on a losing streak, has won more games thus far this season and has a better road record, suggesting a higher win probability. The win probabilities, predicted goals, and confidence rating reflect these factors."

        "explanation": "The simulation for this matchup predicts the home team (FLA) to have a higher chance of victory over the away team (MIN), factoring in their recent form, home record, and overall season performance. The home team's goal differential and recent scoring rate suggest a strong offensive capability, while the away team has conceded notably more goals in their last 10 games and have had a less impressive season record. The predicted goals for each team align with these statistics, and the confidence rating is determined by the magnitude of the difference in win probability. The streak data also supports this prediction, with FLA currently not on a loss streak, while MIN is, further indicating the likelihood of a home team win."

        "simulation results": "1681 - 6554 - 1765",
        "explanation": "The simulation uses the teams' recent performance and season statistics to predict the game's outcome. The home team, CHI, has had a notably difficult season and recent form, as reflected by their negative goal differential and higher number of losses. In contrast, the away team, NYI, while also not in their best form, has had more wins and a less severe goal differential. This simulation suggests that NYI has a higher chance of winning, despite their current losing streak. The confidence rating is based on the difference in win probabilities, and the streak data does not weigh heavily in this prediction due to the overall performance gap."
