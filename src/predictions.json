        "reason": "WSH is at 34.5% after considering the venue, they are facing the away team and have a season goal differential of -17. The away team has a season goal differential of -4 and is on a L streak of length 1.",
        "key factors": "The key factors are the away/home team, percentage chance of winning, and venue. Away team is facing a home team and has 65.5% chance of winning. Venue is a big factor especially considering how far the away team has to travel.",
        "confidence rating": "high",
        "confidence reason": "The percent difference between the two teams is high at 31.0%, this is a high confidence rating.",

        "opposition": "The win streaks of both teams are almost equal and it is difficult to determine which team will be persistent enough to pull off the win here. However, ANA is minus over 50 goal differential so the upset could happen."
